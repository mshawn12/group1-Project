Ticketmaster
Hypothesis: 
What events cost more money to attend?
Are events more expensive in certain states?
Project Description & Outline
In order to test the Group’s hypothesis, the team leveraged the Ticketmaster API along with a number of tools and tactics such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, HVPlots, and various export methods. Using loops, lists, and DataFrames, the team pulled everything from the Event Name, Date, Location (City, State, Longitude, Latitude), Venue, Event Type, Genre, Sub-Genre, Minimum Ticket Price ($), and Maximum Ticket Price ($). Once the core data was collected, the team used a series of filters and visualizations to better understand the story the data was telling. Over (15) DataFrames, (7) map plots, and (12) bar charts were developed to generate the team’s findings and analyses.
Datasets to Be Used
Ticketmaster API
Goals
To implement what we learned in class to attack our first ever data science project.

Research Questions to Answer
Music vs Sports
Number of Events Analyzed by Genre
Is country music more popular in the northeast or south
Number of Events by Sport
Highest Average Price Across the Country by Sport and Music Genre
Rough Breakdown of tasks
By becoming familiar with the documentation we learned how to use the Ticketmaster API and identify what data can be extracted using the free version 
Ensure all the proper libraries are imported to perform task
Leverage cURL method to request event data
Generate core DataFrames to house all event data
Share core Jupyter Notebook file with team in order to do individual testing
Create loops and lists in order to extract and store data
Clean data 
Establish relevant data filters and additional DataFrames 
Discuss findings as a team to determine what hypothesis we we want to address
Create Visualizations to tell story
Reformat visualizations
Export visualizations
Construct Powerpoint to present findings
Create presentation script & conduct dry runs and timing
Record live presentation
Create GitHub repository


Conclusion
Basketball had the highest average price per ticket in sports, and rock had the highest average price for music.
An interesting observation was that Wisconsin, Arizona, and California were the three most expensive locations for ticket sales.
Hockey tickets were the most expensive in North Carolina.
There are many types of factors that can influence the data sets, such as time of year.  California and Arizona are much more pleasant destinations in the winter, as opposed to the Northeast.  Also, music artists announce more concerts in the spring and summer, likely because many sports run in the fall and winter.
We didn’t expect to see Rock ticket prices being the most expensive.
We thought Country music would be more popular in the South, but it was actually more popular in New York
Wisconsin and Arizona were the overall most expensive venues for events, with the Southwest having the highest number of events.

Future Plans

For this project, we used a free API key from Ticketmaster, which was useful, but certainly did not provide unlimited requests and types of data.  If we were to expand on this project in the future, we might consider spending money on a more premium API key from ticketmaster and collecting much more data.  We would also look at secondary markets for scalped ticket data, and consider API keys for sites like StubHub.  Lastly, we would also consider web-scraping as a last resort to gather any data not obtained through Ticketmaster and StubHub.  For example, we could look at places like eBay or Craigslist.
